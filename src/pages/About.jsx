                Formed in 2017, Seedhe Maut emerged from the underground rap battles and cyphers of Delhi. Encore ABJ
                and Calm crossed paths in the local hip-hop scene and quickly recognized their complementary styles.

                Their name "Seedhe Maut," which roughly translates to "straight death" or "direct kill," reflects their
                no-holds-barred approach to rap and their deadly precision on the mic.
